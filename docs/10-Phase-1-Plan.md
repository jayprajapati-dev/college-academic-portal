# Phase 1 Planning
Smart College Academic Portal

---

## 1. Project Title
Smart College Academic Portal

---

## 2. Domain
Web Application / Academic Management System

---

## 3. Proposed Technology Stack (Tentative)

- Frontend: React JS
- Backend: Node JS with Express
- Database: MongoDB

(The final technology stack will be used during development phase.)

---

## 4. Problem Statement
College academic information such as subject details,
marks distribution and notices are scattered across
notice boards, PDFs and messages.

Students often miss important updates and assignment deadlines.

There is no single centralized academic portal for
semester-wise and branch-wise academic information.

---

## 5. Project Objective
- To centralize college academic data
- To show semester-wise and branch-wise subject details
- To display assignments and notices with deadlines
- To allow teachers (admin) to manage academic information

---

## 6. Uniqueness of the System

This project focuses on solving common real-life academic
problems faced by college students and teachers.

1. Many students do not come to college regularly or may miss
important academic information. This portal allows students
to check all subject details, notices and updates online
without depending on calls or messages during exam time.

2. Teachers can post assignments or tasks with deadlines.
If a student is absent on that day or misses the announcement,
they can later check the task online and stay updated.

3. For students who are highly interested in a subject,
the system provides a subject-based library section.
When a student selects a subject, related books with
name, image and short description are displayed,
helping students easily find books from the college library.

4. Students often waste time searching for syllabus,
previous year papers, notes and study materials from
different sources. This system centralizes all academic
materials in one place, making learning more organized
and time-efficient.
